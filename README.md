# Hyprid-Images
This project implements a hybrid images generator and provides functions to apply filters and visualize the results. Hybrid images are optical illusions created by combining the low-frequency content of one image with the high-frequency content of another image. The resulting image will appear as one image when viewed from a distance and transform into the other image when viewed up close.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

# Installation
You can install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

# Examples
You can find example images for testing in the data folder and the results in the results folder.
